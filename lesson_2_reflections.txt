What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git adds metadata (hidden), no commit in the beginning. Need to initialize a repo for version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it is between them and allows to add several files from the wdrto the repo within one commit ( very useful if logically connected files)
